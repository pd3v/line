/*! \mainpage The RtAudio Home Page

RtAudio is a set of C++ classes that provide a common API (Application Programming Interface) for realtime audio input/output across Linux, Macintosh OS-X and Windows operating systems.  RtAudio significantly simplifies the process of interacting with computer audio hardware.  It was designed with the following objectives:

- object-oriented C++ design
- simple, common API across all supported platforms
- only one source and one header file for easy inclusion in programming projects
- allow simultaneous multi-api support
- support dynamic connection of devices
- provide extensive audio device parameter control
- allow audio device capability probing
- automatic internal conversion for data format, channel number compensation, (de)interleaving, and byte-swapping

RtAudio incorporates the concept of audio streams, which represent audio output (playback) and/or input (recording).  Available audio devices and their capabilities can be enumerated and then specified when opening a stream.  Where applicable, multiple API support can be compiled and a particular API specified when creating an RtAudio instance.  See the \ref apinotes section for information specific to each of the supported audio APIs.

\section whatsnew Latest Updates (Version 5.0.0)

The version number has been bumped to 5.0.0 because of the past API change concerning the renaming of the RtError class to RtAudioError.  Changes in this release include:

- WASAPI updates (thanks to Marcus Tomlinson)
- minor exception semantic changes
- miscellaneous build system updates
- see git history for complete list of changes
